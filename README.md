# Pokemon Nuzlocke Discord Bot

Welcome to the Pokemon Nuzlocke Discord Bot! This bot is designed to assist you and your friends in running a Nuzlocke challenge on supported Games. 

## Getting Started

To use the Pokemon Nuzlocke Discord Bot, you'll need to have a few things set up first:

1. A Discord server where you have the necessary permissions to add a bot
2. A bot token for the bot you want to add to your server
3. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer

Once you have these things set up, you can follow these steps to get the bot up and running:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open the repository in your preferred code editor
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project
4. In the `.env` file, add your bot token like this: `token=your-bot-token-here`
5. In your terminal, navigate to the repository and run `npm install`
6. Run `npm start` to start the bot

And that's it! Your bot should now be up and running on your Discord server.
